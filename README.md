# Lost-and-Found
The Lost &amp; Found Portal is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of reporting, tracking, and recovering lost or found belongings within a college campus. It provides a clean and secure way for students to register, authenticate, report items, claim items, verify claims, and communicate through an integrated chat module.
